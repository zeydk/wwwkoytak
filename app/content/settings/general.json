  "welcomeText": "### Hi!\n\nI am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Mississippi and a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Syracuse University. My research focuses on the transformation of taste and consumption in post-war America, examining how racial and spatial inequalities have shaped consumption and racial-ethnic identities.\n\nI hold a B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Economics from Bogazici University and an M.A. in Sociology from Istanbul Sehir University. My research interests include race and ethnicity, immigration, the sociology of food and consumption, and computational methods. My recent work spans a variety of topics, including the framing of Syrian immigration on social media, the role of immigrant social capital in hometown associations, racialized consumption patterns in online restaurant reviews, and state-level policies shaping U.S. life expectancy trends. My co-authored study on U.S. state policies and life expectancy was recognized by the American Sociological Association in 2021.\n\nIn addition to my academic research, I have extensive experience as a co-founder and research team leader at Twittersphere.net and as a theme coordinator for the Turkish General Social Survey. My methodological expertise includes Python, STATA, ATLAS.ti, and ArcGIS, and I specialize in integrating computational techniques with sociological inquiry.\n\nI am an active member of the American Sociological Association, the Population Association of America, and the European Sociological Association. Outside of academia, I am committed to fostering community engagement and mentoring students in their academic and professional development.\n\nFor inquiries or collaborations, contact me [here.](mailto:hkoytak@syr.edu) Also, you can [follow me on X](https://twitter.com/hzkoytak) and check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nestUyQAAAAJ&hl=tr) profile.",
