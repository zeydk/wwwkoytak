  "welcomeText": "### Bio\n\nI am Huseyin Zeyd Koytak, I am currently advancing my research at Syracuse University, where I am working towards my Ph.D. in Sociology. My dissertation project is focused on the transformation of taste and consumption in post-war America.\n\nI earned a B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Economics at Bogazici University. I later pursued M.A. in Sociology at Istanbul Sehir University.\n\nMy primary areas of interest span across race and ethnicity, immigration, the sociology of food and consumption, and computational methods, among others. My contributions to academia include a study on attitudes towards Syrian immigration, immigrant social capital in hometown associations, race and ethnicity in online restaurant reviews and a co-authored work that received acknowledgment from the American Sociological Association in 2021.\n\nIn addition to my written work, I have an extensive background in research. I have taken up significant roles such as co-founder and research team leader at Twittersphere.net and the theme coordinator for the Turkish General Social Survey.\n\nI have been a recipient of several grants and fellowships. I have actively participated in student associations, taking up leadership roles that showcase my dedication to community involvement.\n\nI am a member of the American Sociological Association, Population Association of America and the European Sociological Association.
