  "content": "My research unfolds in three primary trajectories:\n\n1. I utilize the lens of racialization to study the impact of history on constructs like race, ethnicity, nationality, and political identities.\n2. Through my work, I consistently spotlight the significance of space in understanding societal disparities.\n3. My studies question commonly accepted notions in social policy, emphasizing the enduring influence of policy decisions. These decisions create a path that future choices often follow, underscoring the role of historical and contextual elements in shaping political proceedings.\n\n### **Methodologies**\n\nTo navigate these complex issues, I adopt a diverse methodological toolkit. This includes regression models, spatial statistics, computational techniques such as natural language processing, critical discourse analysis, and historical comparative methods using archival data.\n\n1. **State-Level Social Policy and Life Expectancy:** In collaboration with fellow scholars, this research reports the correlation between state-level policies and life expectancy across U.S. states.\n2. **Social Media Discourse on Syrian Immigrants in Turkey:** A large-scale analysis of Twitter discourse surrounding Syrian refugees in Turkey, considering key events such as the global pandemic and the Turkish military offensive into Syria.\n3. **Race, Space, and Taste in Post-War America:** A critical exploration into the dynamics of redlining, residential segregation, and their influence on consumption patterns and culinary preferences in post-WWII America, particularly in Syracuse, New York.\n4. **Ethnic Influence in Restaurant Reviews:** An offshoot of my dissertation, this project uses computational methods to study the role of ethnicity in Syracuse restaurant reviews.\n5. **Migrant Social Capital in Istanbul:** A focused investigation into the effects of internal migration within Turkish society and the solidarity networks it births in urban environments.\n6. **Landscape of Vaccine Hesitancy on Twitter:** A probe into vaccine hesitancy on Twitter, examining its correlation with socio-economic variables in the U.S.\n\n### **Future Directions**\n\nMy future research seeks to enhance the themes from my current projects. I'm especially excited about:\n\n1. **Immigrant Social Capital and Political Ecosystems:** Exploring how immigrant networks evolve and their influence on political landscapes.\n2. **Culture and Consumption in Post-Migration Cities:** Investigating the cultural shifts in cities after significant migratory movements, with a particular focus on consumption spaces and evolving social identities.\n\n### **Relevance & Impact**\n\nI perceive my research as a bridge between academia and real-world applications, with the potential to inform both scholars and policymakers. By weaving together the threads of space, policy, and societal frameworks, I aim to shed light on the social challenges we face. My hope is to help society draw insights from its past, paving the way for a more inclusive and understanding future."
