As I've advanced in my academic journey at Syracuse University, my responsibilities have expandedâ€”encompassing the crafting of syllabi, structuring courses, and crafting a unique educational strategy.\n\nMy teaching philosophy can be encapsulated by three core principles:\n\n1. **Fostering Critical Thinking:** Central to my teaching approach is the cultivation of critical thinking. I actively encourage students to question assumptions, critically evaluate evidence, and engage in in-depth discussions to comprehend complex sociological paradigms. Through these discussions, I aim to guide them to a point where they can effectively dissect intricate sociological phenomena.\n2. **Promoting Empathy & Cultural Competence:** I am committed to creating a classroom atmosphere where diverse perspectives are valued. It is paramount to respect and appreciate the myriad backgrounds students bring to the table. I believe sociology has the potential to bridge divides and create a more inclusive society.\n3. **Imparting Practical Research Skills:** Equally important to my teaching strategy is to arm students with the practical skills vital for conducting thorough sociological research.\n\n### **Courses & Highlights**\n\n**Critical Issues for the United States:** As part of an interdisciplinary team from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, I have contributed to this signature course. Emphasizing fact-based reasoning and democratic values, our primary engagement tool is dialogue. Through extensive reading, respectful discourse, and thoughtful conclusion sharing, this course embodies the essence of democracy in action.\n\n**Social Problems:** In my iterations of this course, I provide a broad overview of the significant social challenges confronting contemporary American society. The goal is to imbue students with a solid foundation in sociological inquiry. Key objectives include identifying major social issues like poverty and racism and understanding their historical and cultural underpinnings.\n\n**Introduction to Research:** Tailored to provide insights into the logic and nuances of social scientific research, this course emphasizes quantitative research methods. From understanding the philosophy of science to learning data analysis using computer software, this course aims to equip students with comprehensive research skills.\n\n**Introduction to Sociology:** This foundational course offers insights into the fundamental concepts, theories, and findings within sociology. It equips students to understand the multifaceted structures of society. The overarching goals include familiarizing students with basic sociological concepts and helping them recognize how societal forces shape individual experiences.\n\nEach course is meticulously designed to not just impart knowledge but to cultivate critical thinking, analytical prowess, and a deep-rooted understanding of the intricacies of sociological inquiry.\n\n### **Student Impact**\n\nThrough my teaching, I have witnessed transformational journeys, like that of Olivia in my 'Introduction to Sociology' class. Her evolution from passive acceptance to active evaluation of sociological theories is a testament to the effectiveness of critical thinking and active engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, as an instructor, I am committed to guiding my students through the expansive world of sociology, ensuring they emerge not just with enhanced knowledge but also the skills and perspective to make meaningful contributions to the field and society at large."
