  "content": "As a sociologist, my teaching philosophy centers on fostering critical thinking, empathy, and practical research skills in my students. I strive to create inclusive learning environments that encourage students to challenge assumptions, engage with diverse perspectives, and develop the tools needed to analyze complex social issues.\n\nIn my teaching, I balance foundational knowledge with hands-on applications. Courses such as *Methods of Social Research* and *Applied Demography* introduce students to key sociological concepts while equipping them with quantitative and qualitative research skills. For example, students design surveys, analyze datasets, and explore real-world applications of sociological methods, preparing them for both academic and professional success.\n\nI also emphasize the integration of technology and data analysis into the classroom, particularly in courses on computational sociology and digital public discourse. These courses enable students to engage with contemporary issues such as polarization and migration through the lens of social media and data-driven research. My goal is to prepare students for a world increasingly shaped by data while maintaining a focus on the human dimensions of inequality.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I am deeply committed to mentoring students. Whether guiding research projects on urban inequality or supporting graduate students in their academic journeys, I strive to nurture curiosity and confidence. I believe teaching is not just about transmitting knowledge but about empowering students to think critically, collaborate effectively, and contribute meaningfully to their communities."
