  "content": "I am a sociologist specializing in the intersections of race, immigration, consumption, and social policy. My research explores how historical and contemporary processes, such as segregation, urban renewal, and digital discourse, shape social inequalities and cultural practices. Through a combination of computational, spatial, and qualitative methods, I examine how space, policy, and culture intersect to reinforce or challenge systems of inequality.\n\nOne of my key projects, *Race, Space, and Taste in Post-War America*, investigates how mid-20th-century segregation policies, such as redlining and urban renewal, shaped urban consumption patterns and the formation of White middle-class identity. This work highlights the cultural and spatial dimensions of inequality in post-war American cities. Another strand of my research focuses on digital public discourse, using natural language processing to analyze online conversations around migration and inequality. These studies reveal how digital platforms foster both polarization and solidarity. I am also studying immigrant social capital, examining how immigrant networks influence political participation and representation in urban contexts.\n\nMy methodological approach integrates natural language processing, spatial analysis, archival research, and statistical techniques to uncover how cultural practices and spatial arrangements intersect with broader systems of inequality. By blending traditional sociological inquiry with cutting-edge computational tools, my work offers new insights into the mechanisms that sustain or challenge social disparities.\n\nUltimately, my research bridges academic theory and real-world application, offering practical insights for policymakers, community organizations, and public institutions. By illuminating the cultural and spatial dimensions of inequality, I aim to contribute to more equitable and inclusive societal outcomes."
